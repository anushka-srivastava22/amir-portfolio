                                    learn and implement new technologies. Coding is my love, and I am a focused and
                                    hardworking professional. One of my strengths is creating a positive atmosphere
                                    wherever I go, while my weakness is my relentless attitude of never giving up until
                                    I achieve my goals. In my leisure time, I enjoy traveling and my hobbies include
                                    listening to songs and dancing.</p>
